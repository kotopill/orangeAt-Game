# orangeAt-Game
Hello.
Thank you for traying to play my game. This is my first game written in JavaScript, this is also my first thing in javascript. It took me 7 days to make this game. To control the character you use arrow keys. I am a 14 year old Java programmer, and I hope you can give me some feed back on my game.
